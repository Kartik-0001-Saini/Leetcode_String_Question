Question 205.) --> Isomorphic Strings
Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.

Two strings s and t are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.

class Solution {
public:
    bool isIsomorphic(string s, string t) {
        unordered_map<char, char> mp1;
        unordered_map<char, char> mp2;

        for(int i=0; i<s.size(); i++){
            char char1 = s[i];
            char char2 = t[i];

            if(mp1.find(char1) != mp1.end() && mp1[char1] != char2){
                return false;
            }

            if(mp2.find(char2) != mp2.end() && mp2[char2] != char1){
                return false;
            }

            mp1[char1] = char2;
            mp2[char2] = char1;
        }

        return true;
    }
};

In this question I will take two maps and check each map that key of one is not equal to value of other one.
If, it doesn't then I return false. Otherwise true.
